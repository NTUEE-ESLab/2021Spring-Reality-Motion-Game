## Setup
- Configure the Wi-Fi shield to use.

   Edit `mbed_app.json` to include the correct Wi-Fi shield, SSID and password. In our example, `wifi-shield`is "WIFI_ISM43362". Notice that STM32 usually support only 802.11g, so you may have to check your wifi configuration.

   ```
       "config": {
            "wifi-shield": {
                    "help": "Options are WIFI_IDW0XX1",
                    "value": "WIFI_IDW0XX1"
                    },
            "wifi-ssid": {
                "help": "WiFi SSID",
                "value": "\"SSID\""
            },
            "wifi-password": {
                "help": "WiFi Password",
                "value": "\"Password\""
            }
       }
   ```

- Import Sensor library `BSP_B-L475E-IOT01` and `wifi-ism43362`. There is a button under the bottom right corner of the screen.

## Motivation

### Motion Detection

### Location Service

### Game Design

## Implementation

### Architecture
![Project Architecture](./images/architecture.png)

### Data Layer

### WiFi Layer
We implement a wifi wrapper class over the data sensor, which will get motion type from the sensor on a certain interval, then send this information to the game server.

### Game Layer
We write out game program based on a spaceship shooting game from the web. The player have to move around the screen to find the treasure. If the player collides with asteroids, the player lose the game. If the player collect all treasures, it wins.
